# JWT Authentication Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Implementation Complete!

Your NestJS Stock Management API now has **complete JWT authentication** with role-based access control. Here's what was accomplished:

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **JWT Authentication System**

- User registration and login
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- JWT token generation and validation
- Refresh token functionality
- Profile management

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**

- **Admin**: Full access to all user and stock operations
- **Manager**: Can manage stocks and view users
- **User**: Can view own profile and stocks

### 3. **Protected Endpoints**

- All user management routes require authentication
- All stock management routes require authentication
- Role-specific restrictions on create/delete operations

### 4. **Security Features**

- Password hashing before storage
- JWT tokens with expiration
- User status checking (active/inactive)
- Input validation on all endpoints

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes (`/auth`)

- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile (protected)
- `PATCH /auth/profile` - Update profile (protected)
- `POST /auth/change-password` - Change password (protected)
- `POST /auth/refresh-token` - Refresh JWT token (protected)

### User Management (`/users`)

- `POST /users` - Create user (Admin only)
- `GET /users` - List all users (Admin/Manager)
- `GET /users/profile` - Get own profile (All authenticated)
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID (Admin/Manager)
- `PATCH /users/profile` - Update own profile (All authenticated)
- `PATCH /users/:id` - Update user (Admin only)
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user (Admin only)

### Stock Management (`/stocks`)

- `POST /stocks` - Create stock (Manager/Admin)
- `GET /stocks` - List stocks (All authenticated)
- `GET /stocks/:id` - Get stock details (All authenticated)
- `PATCH /stocks/:id` - Update stock (Manager/Admin)
- `DELETE /stocks/:id` - Delete stock (Manager/Admin)

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **NestJS** with TypeScript
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose
- **JWT** with Passport
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **Role-based guards** and decorators
- **Comprehensive logging** with interceptors
- **Extended status monitoring**

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test file `api-tests.http` is included with:

- Complete authentication flow examples
- Role-based access tests
- All CRUD operations
- Error scenarios
- JWT token usage examples

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Server runs on:** `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Test the API** using the included `api-tests.http` file in VS Code with REST Client extension

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Register** a new user via `POST /auth/register`
2. **Login** to get JWT token via `POST /auth/login`
3. **Use token** in Authorization header: `Bearer <your_jwt_token>`
4. **Access protected routes** with proper role permissions

## 📝 Example Usage

```bash
# Register
POST /auth/register
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "user"
}

# Login
POST /auth/login
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

# Use token in subsequent requests
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## 🎉 All Requirements Fulfilled

✅ MongoDB integration  
✅ Auto-restart development server  
✅ API logging interceptors  
✅ Database log persistence  
✅ Extended status monitoring  
✅ **Complete JWT authentication system**

Your Stock Management API is now production-ready with enterprise-level authentication and authorization!
